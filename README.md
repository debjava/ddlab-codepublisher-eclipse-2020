**Code Publisher** is an eclipse plugin which helps in publishing and sharing the complete codebase or code snippet directly to GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket.  This plugin does not provide any git functionality, it only provides an easy way to keep the code in [GitHub.com](https://github.com/), [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/) or [Bitbucket.com](https://bitbucket.org/) for future references.
